                <span>About our project</span><br><br>
                We’ve created a unique platform that blends the worlds of art and technology to offer a deeper, more meaningful experience for art lovers, students, and museum visitors alike. Our project brings together digital art curation, artificial intelligence, and interactive design—all in one place. <br>

                <br>
                <span>What is it?</span><br><br>
                Our project consists of four major components: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital Art Library – A collection of paintings and sculptures stored in an organized, accessible digital format.</li>
                    <li>Categorized Collections – Artworks are sorted by style, period, artist, and themes for easy exploration.</li>
                    <li>AI-Based Art Interpreter – A machine learning model trained to interpret artworks by analyzing their style, emotion, and historical background (e.g., WW2, movements, culture).</li>
                    <li>Museum Promotion Page – A dedicated section that promotes museum events, exhibitions, and featured collections.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><hr><br>
                <span>Why did we make it?</span><br><br>
                We believe art is more than just visual—it's emotional, historical, and deeply human. However, many people struggle to understand the true meaning behind a painting or sculpture. So we built this platform to: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make art more understandable and accessible</li>
                    <li>Help users connect emotionally with artworks</li>
                    <li>Use AI to reveal the stories and context behind each piece</li>
                    <li>Promote digital learning and museum engagement</li>
                </ul><br><hr><br><br>

                    Art is not just what you see, but what you help others feel and understand.

                <span>Problem Statement</span><br><br>
                Art holds powerful emotions, stories, and historical significance—but most people only see what's on the surface. Without proper guidance or background, viewers often miss the deeper meaning, artist’s intent, or historical context behind a painting or sculpture. Traditional museum labels or online descriptions are often brief, non-interactive, and hard to understand for the general audience. There is a need for a smarter, more engaging, and educational way to interpret and experience art—one that connects users emotionally, historically, and intellectually with each piece.
